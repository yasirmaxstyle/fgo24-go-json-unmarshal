# UNMARSHALLING `JSON` DATA FROM FETCH API IN GO
This project demonstrates how to fetch data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users using Go's standard net/http package, parse the JSON response, unmarshal it into Go types (structs), and display the data cleanly in the terminal.

## Features
- Makes HTTP GET requests using Go's net/http package.
- Parses and unmarshals JSON responses into native Go types.
- Prints structured and readable output in the terminal.
- Handles basic errors such as failed requests or malformed JSON.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- HTTP requests with net/http
- Reading response bodies
- JSON parsing with encoding/json
- Struct definition for JSON unmarshaling
- Data transformation and formatting
- Graceful error handling
